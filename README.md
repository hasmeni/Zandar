# Zandar 

***A local-first, privacy-focused & highly customizable browser startpage***

It works offline, stores everything locally, and doesn’t require login. You can use it as a new tab, homepage, or a simple bookmark manager. Still early, but usable.

## Features (current MVP):

- Local-first storage (IndexedDB + browser localstorage)
- No login or account required
- Fast local search across saved links
- Auto-fetch page titles and favicons
- Import / export (JSON backup)
- Drag & drop layout for links and widgets
- Multi-column grid control
- Background presets (image)
- Support for local background images and Videos
- Dark-only, calm UI

---

## Working on:

- Browser extension support (new tab override + Quick save)
- More widget types
- Code cleanup and refactor

---

## Project Status

This project works as intended, but the **codebase is messy**.

I’m actively using it, but a proper refactor is in progress. Some parts evolved quickly during experimentation and haven’t been cleaned up yet.

If you’re browsing the code and things look rough, that’s fair. Cleanup is ongoing.

*Also This is my first time managing an open-source project, so suggestions and improvements are very welcome.*

## Self-Hosting / Development Setup

Self-hosting and setup documentation is **not ready yet**.

Once the code cleanup stabilizes, I’ll add:
- Clear dev setup instructions
- Self-hosting notes
- Build and deployment details

For now, consider this repo **early but open**.

## Feedback

This project is shared early to get feedback and real usage insights.

If you self-host dashboards or use startpages regularly, I’d especially appreciate thoughts on:
- Missing basics
- UX friction
- What you actually use daily vs ignore
